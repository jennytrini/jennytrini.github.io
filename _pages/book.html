<p>My first book, <i><a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/gathering-social-network-data/book260973">Gathering Social Network Data</a></i> is now out in SAGE's Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences ("little green book") series. 
The book describes the principles of social network data collection, platforms available for doing so, ethical considerations therein, and the evaluation of social network data quality. 
I included a number of primary instruments in Appendices that I think are especially helpful for illustrating some of the points in the book.</p>

<p>While the book was in process, I posted it for "Open Review" and think the final text definitely benefited from that process, something I described briefly <a href="https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2018/10/23/guest-post-so-you-want-to-post-your-book-for-open-review/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can listen to me talk about the book in <a href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/jimi-adams-gathering-social-network-data-sage-2019/">an episode</a> of the "New Books in Sociology" podcast, below.</p>
