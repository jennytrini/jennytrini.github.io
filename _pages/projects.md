### IDEAS: Interdisciplinary Dynamics in Emerging Areas of Science
<img src="../images/PO_alluvial.png" width="200px" align="right" />

With [Ryan Light](https://sociology.uoregon.edu/profile/light/), I am examining patterns of disciplinary integration in "problem" oriented areas of science. My primary sabbatical project is working on a book manuscript from this work.

(This work has previously been funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's [Health and Society Scholars Program](http://www.healthandsocietyscholars.org/) at Columbia University.)

### Diffusion Processes: Social Network Influences on Health Behaviors & Outcomes

What do smoking, HIV/AIDS, hypertension and flu have in common? The possibility of being shaped by one's peers and shaping who we select as friends. I'm primarily interesed in the diffusion/influence part of these processes, but estimating those properly also requires accounting for the selection side of the equation. 

(This work has previously been funded in part by the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.lrp.nih.gov/eligibility-programs#ex-disparities-content), and the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment.)

### Network Methods: Evaluating & Improving Social Network Data Collection Methods
<img style="float:right; padding-left: 20px" src="../images/FM_sample.png" height="200px;"/>

Development of network theory and analytic strategies have occasionally outpaced the availability of data. I'm interested in altering that, and evaluating the quality of such efforts.
