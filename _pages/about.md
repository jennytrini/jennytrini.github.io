recent updates (September 2021)
------
 I am currently on sabbatical at Bocconi University's [Dondena Centre](https://www.dondena.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/cdr/dondena/home) in Milan. 
 Stay tuned for news about a forthcoming book and new projects. Expect that I will be slow to respond to email. 
 
about me
------
I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu), where I also direct the [Center for International Social Science Research](https://cissr.uchicago.edu/). I recently completed a 5-year term as director of sociology's [undergraduate program](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/content/undergraduate-major-0), and I chair the Global Society Core sequence for the Social Sciences.

My training is in two areas: social demography & the sociology of religion. Bridging these two fields, my work features the demographerâ€™s characteristic concern with data quality and denominators and an insistence on connecting demographic processes to questions of meaning.

Before moving to UChicago, I was an Assistant Professor at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu) and at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), where I was affiliated with the Center for Population Dynamics (sadly, now defunct). 

I was trained at The University of Texas at Austin's [Sociology Department](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/) and [Population Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/) and received my BA from [Marquette University](https://marquette.edu).
