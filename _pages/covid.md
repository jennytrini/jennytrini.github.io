### Colorado COVID-19 Modeling Team
Since March, I've been working with a team modeling various aspects of SARS-COV-2 spread and other aspects of COVID-19 response for the state of Colorado. I'm collecting those updates together here:

- **Epidemiological modeling report & updates**: Dec 4 (w/ CDPHE press release), Nov 20 (press release), Nov 4 (press release),  Oct 28 (press release), Oct 21 (press release), Sept 30, Sept 11 (press release), August 21, July 16 (press release), June 1,  May 23 (press release), April 20 (press release).
- **Regional modeling report**: Nov 24, Nov 12.
- **Population mixing & administrative boundaries report**: July 6.
- **Mobility report**:  May 14 (w/ press release).

### Science Communication
In addition to that work, I've also written/presented a few pieces trying to publicly translate relevant elements of the pandemic:

- On misperceptions about modeling, Sept 1 at Medium.
- On misinformation, June 15 in a CU-Denver open Course.
- On epidemiological models, Apr 8 in The Society Pages.
- On flattening the curve, Mar 15 for the IAPHS blog.
- On some basics of epidemics, Mar 7 at Medium.
