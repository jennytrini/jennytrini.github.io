While these courses represent some of my teaching interests, further course topics i am interested in include, Organizations, Sociology of Religion, Science of Science, global HIV/AIDS, and likely a few others I'm not thinking of as courses at the moment. If you are a student interested in these topics, or an instructor who may want to explore collaborative teaching, let me know.
