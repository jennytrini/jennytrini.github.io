### UChicago Workshops I Participate In
  [**PRC Demography Workshop**](https://voices.uchicago.edu/popcenter/workshops/demography-workshop/) Hosted by the Population Research Center at the University of Chicago, this weekly workshop is where demographers gather to exchange ideas about works-in-progress. I expect the UChicago students I advise to attend regularly.
  
  [**African Studies Workshop**](https://africanstudies.uchicago.edu/news/current-schedule/) A bi-weekly workshop hosted by the Committee on African Studies at the University of Chicago. Possibly the longest-continuously-running workshop on our campus.

### For Prospective PhD Students
I am looking to advise PhD students working in the areas of fertility and family formation, religion and social change, and sexual and reproductive health, including HIV & AIDS.

### For UChicago Students Requesting Letters of Recommendation 

Graduate and undergraduate students often need letters of recommendation to pursue a variety of goals (jobs, fellowships, graduate programs, etc.) If I can strongly recommend you based on prior coursework or interactions through a research assistantship, I will agree to serve as a letter-writer. If I don't know you well enough to write a strong and honest letter that conveys specific information about your strengths and weaknesses, I will let you know that you'd be better served by asking someone else. Please keep in mind that I get nearly 50 LOR requests each year, and a good letter takes me almost a full day to write, so I cannot respond positively to all requests. 

If I agree to provide you with a LOR, here are some things you can do to help me with the letter-writing task. Send: 
- Your resume or CV
- Any application materials you sent in with your application
- 1-2 pages of bullet points about things you’d like me to cover or speak to. This explanation of “bullet points” is [stolen from website of a colleague at Princeton](https://scholar.princeton.edu/bstewart/recommendation) Bullet points are not a draft letter but a summary ofpoints you want in my mind as I write. Please send me an actual document (pdf or word), as this is easier for me to keep track of than an email. Please include:
 - A brief statement about who else is writing your letters and what if anything that you are hoping my letter will speak to that your other writers cannot (e.g. I am the only person who has seen your data-wrangling skills and you want me to speak to that.)
 - Any application-specific requirements or suggestions about what the letter should contain.
 - A short description of you see your research agenda being pitched.  (I won't use this directly, but it is helpful for me to know how you are representing yourself.)
 
Deadlines:
 - Please send your request and the specific deadlines about 2 months in advance, so I can plan for this in my calendar.
 - Please send me ALL your materials 2 weeks in advance of the deadline.
 - If you don't have confirmation of sent/received from me or some kind of online system, please send me a gentle reminder 2 days before the rec letter is due.
