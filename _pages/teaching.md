NOTE: I am on sabbatical for the 2020-21 school year and will not be teaching, or taking on any new students for the year.

### CU-Denver

  - PBHL 4040, **Social Determinants of Health** - This senior-level course serves as the theoretical core of our undergraduate Public Health major, focusing on multiple  bases of population health inequalities.
    - [2020S](../files/2020S_PBHL4040_syllabus.pdf), 
    [2017S](../files/2017S_PBHL4040_syllabus.pdf),
    [2016S](../files/2016S_PBHL4040_syllabus.pdf)
  - PBHL 4099, **Capstone Experience in Public Health**

While these courses represent some of my teaching interests, further course topics i am interested in include, Organizations, Sociology of Religion, Science of Science, global HIV/AIDS, and likely a few others I'm not thinking of as courses at the moment. If you are a student interested in these topics, or an instructor who may want to explore collaborative teaching, let me know.
