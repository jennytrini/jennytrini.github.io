Students Requesting Letters of Recommendation 

Graduate and undergraduate students often need letters of recommendation to pursue a variety of goals (jobs, fellowships, graduate programs, etc.) If I can strongly recommend you based on prior coursework or interactions through a research assistantship, I will agree to serve as a letter-writer. If I don't know you well enough to write a strong and honest letter that conveys specific information about your strengths and weaknesses, it is better for you to ask someone else.  

Here is some guidance for what you can do to help me with the task.
Send me your resume and any application materials you sent in with your application
Send me ½ a page of bullet points about things you’d like me to cover or speak to. This explanation of “bullet points” is [stolen from website of a colleague at Princeton](https://scholar.princeton.edu/bstewart/recommendation) Bullet points are not a draft letter but a summary ofpoints you want in my mind as I write. Please send me an actual document (pdf or word), as this is easier for me to keep track of than an email. Please include: 
A brief statement about who else is writing your letters and what if anything that you are hoping my letter will speak to that your other writers cannot (e.g. I am the only statistician and you want me to speak to your quantitative skills, or I am familiar with a particular project you worked on but no one else is, etc.).   
Any application specific-requirements or suggestions about what the letter should contain. 
A short description of you see your research agenda being pitched.  (I won't use this directly, but it is helpful for me to know how you are representing yourself.) 
 
Deadlines:
Please send me the specific deadlines about 2 months in advance, so I can plan for this in my calendar.
Please send me ALL your materials 2 weeks in advance of the deadline.
If you don't have confirmation of sent/received from me or some kind of online system, please send me a kind reminder 2 days before the rec letter is due.
