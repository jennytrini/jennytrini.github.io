### Letters
For UChicago Students Requesting Letters of Recommendation 

Graduate and undergraduate students often need letters of recommendation to pursue a variety of goals (jobs, fellowships, graduate programs, etc.) If I can strongly recommend you based on prior coursework or interactions through a research assistantship, I will agree to serve as a letter-writer. If I don't know you well enough to write a strong and honest letter that conveys specific information about your strengths and weaknesses, I will let you know that you'd be better served by asking someone else. Please keep in mind that I get nearly 50 LOR requests each year, and a good letter takes almost a full day to write, so I cannot respond positively to all requests. 

If I agree to provide you with a LOR, here are some things you can do to help me with the letter-writing task.
Send me your resume and any application materials you sent in with your application
Send me ½ a page of bullet points about things you’d like me to cover or speak to. This explanation of “bullet points” is [stolen from website of a colleague at Princeton](https://scholar.princeton.edu/bstewart/recommendation) Bullet points are not a draft letter but a summary ofpoints you want in my mind as I write. Please send me an actual document (pdf or word), as this is easier for me to keep track of than an email. Please include: 
A brief statement about who else is writing your letters and what if anything that you are hoping my letter will speak to that your other writers cannot (e.g. I am the only statistician and you want me to speak to your quantitative skills, or I am familiar with a particular project you worked on but no one else is, etc.).   
Any application specific-requirements or suggestions about what the letter should contain. 
A short description of you see your research agenda being pitched.  (I won't use this directly, but it is helpful for me to know how you are representing yourself.) 
 
Deadlines:
Please send me the specific deadlines about 2 months in advance, so I can plan for this in my calendar.
Please send me ALL your materials 2 weeks in advance of the deadline.
If you don't have confirmation of sent/received from me or some kind of online system, please send me a kind reminder 2 days before the rec letter is due.
