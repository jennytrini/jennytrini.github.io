<h2>Unbounded Science</h2>
<p>My second book (co-authored with <a href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/light/">Ryan Light</a>) is recently under contract with <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu">Columbia University Press</a>. It's tentatively titled <i>Unbounded Science: Knowledge Across the Disciplines</i>, and is the result of our long-standing <a href="https://jimiadams.github.io/projects/ideas/">IDEAS project</a>. In it, we seek to theorize the mechanisms underpinning scientific fields comprised of multiple disciplines, and demonstrate how those operate in a range of case studies. We use a combination of methods, focused especially on social network and computational text analytic approaches.</p>

<h2>Gathering Social Network Data</h2>

<p>My first book, <i><a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/gathering-social-network-data/book260973">Gathering Social Network Data</a></i> is now out in SAGE's Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences ("little green book") series. The book describes the principles of social network data collection, platforms available for doing so, ethical considerations therein, and the evaluation of social network data quality. I included a number of primary instruments in Appendices that I think are especially helpful for illustrating some of the points in the book.<br /></p>
  
<p>While the book was in process, I posted it for "Open Review" and think the final text definitely benefited from that process, something I described briefly <a href="https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2018/10/23/guest-post-so-you-want-to-post-your-book-for-open-review/">here</a>.<br /></p>

<p>You can listen to me talk about the book in <a href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/jimi-adams-gathering-social-network-data-sage-2019/">an episode</a> of the "New Books in Sociology" podcast, below.</p>
