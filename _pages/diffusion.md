This area has been a core thread in my research since early in graduate school. A main interest of mine with SNA is examining how the structure of networks promote or constrain a population's diffusion potential. Over the years this has taken a number of forms, and has involved a lot of fun methods & collaborators.

### From Behaviors to Identities
Over the past few years, I've worked with [David Schaefer](https://sites.google.com/site/drschaef/) to use recent advances in statistically modeling the coevolution of social network and behavioral data--via exponential random graph (ERG) and stochastic actor based (SAB) models--to examine smoking behavior and intervention potentials. Recently, we've begun thinking about new ways to use these models that is more consistent with theories of religious and health "identities."

### HIV (& other STD) epidemic modeling
This area of my work all started out with thinking about the spread (or control) of HIV in a variety of populations. I've worked with primary data (in [Malawi](https://malawi.pop.upenn.edu/malawi-data-mlsfh)), secondary data (from [Colorado Springs](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/22140); here's a [clip of the PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBAzXUrqag) talking about the launch of the project), and simulations in this work. The punchline is that structural features of networks can operate independently of individual level behaviors to substantially alter a population's epidemic potential. In next phases of this work, I'm interested in exploring how different layers of multiplex networks combine in complementary and contradictory ways.

### Networks & Health
While the strands described above highlight some specific projects, this all fits within a broader interest of thinking about how health and networks are related in a broad sense. Recent advances in this field can be seen in our recent [special issue](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/coevolution-of-networks-and-health/05DE4786C25DA517B2A12E33B98ECCE3) of *Network Science*.  For the bulk of 2020, I incporated this perspective into efforts contributing to a team [modeling COVID-19](..covid/) for the state of Colorado.
